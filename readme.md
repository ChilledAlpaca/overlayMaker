Profile Overlay / Avatar Border 

This project is a website to add an overlay on another image (like a flag or something like that).
Just using javascript/canvas - no other plugin involved

Requirements:
- overlay picture in 1080x1080 (testet with png)

Function: 
- takes an image and scale it up/down to the size of the overlay picture. (Scale depends on the smaller dimension)
- crop the middle of the picture
- works on horizontal or vertical images
- download the canvas (note: when executed locally then the browser will scream for https)

Future planned functions: 
- zoom image
- move image
- rotate image
